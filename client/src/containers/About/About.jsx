        My name is Garrett Lee. I am from Tallahassee, FL, but I now live in
        Peachtree Corners, GA. I originally went to Florida State University and
        graduated with a degree in English which, at the time, was just a
        stepping stone towards film school. I went to Full Sail University in
        Orlando, FL and graduated after a couple of years. I found my first job
        in the film industry pretty quickly, but just as quickly realized that
        that lifestyle was not for me. I have been through a lot at this point
        and have now landed in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, seeking a new
        career path for myself in Web Development.

        This page is one of my first projects that I have created from scratch.
        It is also one of the projects that I will continue to update in the
        future as I add new pieces to my portfolio. Keep checking back for more
        updates!
